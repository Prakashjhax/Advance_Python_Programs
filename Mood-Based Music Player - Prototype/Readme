## 🌟 Overview

**Mood-Based Music Player** is an intelligent Python application that detects your **current mood** through:
- 🎥 **Facial Emotion Recognition** via webcam  
- ✍️ **Text Sentiment Analysis** via typed input  

…and automatically plays **mood-matching music** either from your **local library** or **Spotify playlists**.  

> Because music hits differently when it matches your emotions. 🎶
